## Car Price Prediction with Linear Regression and Lasso Regression

### Introduction

This repository contains the code for predicting car prices using linear regression and Lasso regression. The code is based on a Jupyter notebook originally generated by Colab.

### Functionality

This code performs the following tasks:

* **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning with scikit-learn.
* **Data Loading and Exploration:**
  * Loads the car data from a CSV file (`car data.csv`) into a pandas dataframe.
  * Displays the first few rows (`head()`).
  * Checks data shape (number of rows and columns).
  * Provides summary statistics (`describe()`).
  * Analyzes the distribution of categorical features using groupby and value counts.
  * Identifies missing values using `np.sum(car_dataset.isnull())`.
* **Data Preprocessing:**
  * Converts categorical features like "Fuel_Type", "Seller_Type", "Transmission" into numerical values for machine learning compatibility.
  * Replaces string values with numerical codes (e.g., "CNG" -> 0, "Diesel" -> 1).
  * Handles missing values (if any) - not explicitly shown in this code snippet.
* **Feature Split and Label Definition:**
  * Separates the features (independent variables) from the target label (Selling_Price).
* **Train-Test Split:** Splits the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn to ensure model generalizability.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:**
  * Trains a Linear Regression model using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn.
  * Fits the model to the training data.
  * Evaluates the model's performance on both training and testing data using R-squared (`r2_score`) from `metrics`.
  * Reports the R-squared scores for both sets.
  * Visualizes the relationship between actual prices and predicted prices using a scatter plot (Matplotlib).
  * Performs Lasso Regression:
    * Trains a Lasso Regression model using `Lasso` from scikit-learn.
    * Evaluates and visualizes the results similar to Linear Regression.

### Running the Code

This code is intended to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment. You can follow these steps:

1. Download the code and data files.
2. Open the `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially.

### Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

ference to th**Note:** This is a basic example of Car Price prediction using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. Additional techniques like feature engineering, handling missing values, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring different regression algorithms can be explored for potentially improved performance.
